        ES6 was a significant step forward for the JavaScript language,<br>
        and its features have become widely adopted in modern JavaScriptbr <br>
        development. It provided a more structured and predictable <br>
        foundation for building complex applications and improved the <br>
        overall developer experience. Subsequent versions of the ECMAScript <br>
        specification (such as ES2016, ES2017, and so on) have continued <br>
        to introduce additional features and enhancements to the language.
